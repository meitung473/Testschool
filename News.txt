China has successfully landed a spacecraft on Mars, state media announced early on Saturday.
The six-wheeled Zhurong robot was targeting Utopia Planitia, a vast terrain in the planet's northern hemisphere.
The vehicle used a combination of a protective capsule, a parachute and a rocket platform to make the descent.
The successful touchdown is a remarkable achievement, given the difficult nature of the task.
Only the Americans have really mastered landing on Mars until now. All other countries that have tried have either crashed or lost contact soon after reaching the surface.
Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated the mission team on its "outstanding achievement" in a special message.
"You were brave enough for the challenge, pursued excellence and placed our country in the advanced ranks of planetary exploration," he said.
Thomas Zurbuchen, the head of science at the US space agency (Nasa), was quick also to add his own congratulations.
"Together with the global science community, I look forward to the important contributions this mission will make to humanity's understanding of the Red Planet," he said.
The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, said the success augured well for its future cooperation with China.
